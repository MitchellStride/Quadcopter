The plan is to use an old google cardboard headset to create a prototype headset,
and then 3D-print a final revision. I decided to make a prototype because I am concerned
about the visual lag for the video from the connection between the analog receiver
and my digital phone screen. I also already had a few parts so it was feasible.

I found a webpage where someone had a similar setup (source below) and bought a DVR
with a utv007 chip that was compatible with the easycap app on the google playstore.

Here is the finished prototype with everything laid out and connected the way I
thought was best. From testing, I realized one thing I will have to implement in the next revision is extending the length of the headset screen from my face. The other main
features will be just adding holders for all the other gear and making it comfortable.

## 3D-Modeling

I am using SOLIDWORKS to model the headset. Since I upgraded the build plate on my
Monoprice Select Mini v2 printer to 200x200mm I can print the whole thing in one piece.
