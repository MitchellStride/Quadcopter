# 3D-Printed Mods
  I bought the LS210 frame for my quadcopter and I made some upgrades for
this frame. If anyone wants the models to print them for themselves
they are available for download on my <a href="https://github.com/MitchellStride/Quadcopter/tree/master/3Dprintedmods/Models">github</a>. I also posted the .SLDPRT if someone
wanted to improve them.
<p>
 The Headset and Gimbal models can also both be found in the same folders.

## GOPRO Top Mount
Used my fathers gopro to record some better quality footage when flying quickly and racing.
The gimbal is more for photography style flying.

## Landing Gear
easier take off and adds protected space to add a gimbal below frame

## Propellor Guards
Because im not good at flying and this will also protect the props.

## Better Side Panels
Better protection and it is easier to deal with when taking the top panel off
