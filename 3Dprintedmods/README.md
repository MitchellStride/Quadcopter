## 3D-Printed Mods
  I bought the LS210 frame for my quadcopter and I made some upgrades for
this frame. If anyone wants the models to print them for themselves
they are available for download on my github. I also posted the .SLDPRT if someone
wanted to improve them.
<br>  The Headset and Gimbal models can also both be found in the same folders.
