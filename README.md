# Project Page Under Construction

## Purpose
To build my own quadcopter because it will be fun to make and fly. It will serve
 as a low cost entry to the hobby and if anything goes wrong or it breaks,
 I will be able to fix it because I made it.
 <br>I am also hoping to add future functionality such as a mount for a recording
 camera or maybe a small claw.

## Plan
I have done some research on popular parts for cheap first quadcopter builds
and decided on these parts.
<br>
<img src="{{ "/pictures/blockcopter.png?raw=true" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>This block diagram is how I am going to put together the quadcopter. The three
main PCBs in the middle are called the "stack". Mine consists of a Racerstar 4in1 ESC,
Matek Power Board, and a F3 Flight controller. They will be fixated to the frame with
standoffs. The receiver will be under the Stack. The camera will be mounted to the front
with a wire leading to the VTX in the back.

<br>Waiting on Frame to finish the build and complete project page.


## FPV Goggles Prototype
<br>
<img src="{{ "/pictures/goggleparts.jpg?raw=true" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
The plan is to use an old google cardboard headset to create a prototype headset,
and then 3dprint a final revision. I decided to make a prototype because I am concerned
about the visual lag for the video from the connection between the analog receiver
and my digital phone screen. I also already had a few parts so it was feasible.

<br>
I found a webpage where someone had a similar setup (source below) and bought a DVR
with a utv007 chip that was compatible with the easycap app on the google playstore.
